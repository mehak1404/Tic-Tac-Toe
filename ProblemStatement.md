### Tic Tac Toe 

## Question:
Build a Terminal-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Design and implement a terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game in your preferred programming language. The game should meet the 

## following requirements:
# Game Modes:
Support two-player mode where two users can play against each other on the same terminal.
Support a single-player mode where the user plays against an AI opponent.
# Game Features:
Display the Tic-Tac-Toe board after each move.
Validate user inputs to ensure valid moves (e.g., the move is within bounds and on an empty cell).
Detect game-ending conditions such as win, loss, or draw, and announce the result.
# AI Behavior:
Implement a simple AI opponent that makes reasonable moves (e.g., blocking the player's win or choosing a winning move if possible).
# User Interface:
Use clear prompts to ask for input (e.g., which mode to play, which cell to mark).
Keep the terminal output user-friendly and easy to follow.
# Code Structure:
Write clean, modular, and readable code with appropriate functions or classes for the game's logic.
Evaluation Criteria:
# Functionality: 
Does the game meet the requirements for both game modes and handle edge cases?
# Code Quality: 
Is the code modular, readable, and free of significant bugs?
# AI Implementation: 
How effectively does the AI play the game?
# User Experience: 
Is the game intuitive and easy to play in the terminal?
